# 🐾 Pet Store -Web Application
## Full-Stack Pet & Product Management System (Django)


## 📌 Introduction  
The **Pet Store Web Application** is a full-stack platform built using **Django** that allows users to browse pets and pet-related products through a clean and intuitive interface.

Unlike basic static websites, this application provides **dynamic content management, backend-driven listings, and an admin panel** for managing pets and products. The system is designed to demonstrate **clean architecture, responsive UI, and efficient backend data handling**, making it suitable for learning full-stack development and building real-world web applications.
